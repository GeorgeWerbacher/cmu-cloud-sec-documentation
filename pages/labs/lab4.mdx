9. Create a security incident playbook for common AWS security events

## Security Monitoring in AWS

Before diving into hands-on exercises, it's important to understand the key security monitoring components in AWS:

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Records API calls for your account and delivers log files
- **AWS Config**: Provides resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications
- **AWS Security Hub**: Provides a comprehensive view of your security posture across AWS accounts
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Intelligent threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability service that provides data and insights
- **AWS EventBridge**: Serverless event bus that connects application data from your own apps and AWS services
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Provides visibility and control of your AWS resources
- **Amazon Inspector**: Automated security assessment service that helps improve security and compliance

## Reference Architecture

```

This architecture implements:
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All API activity is recorded and stored securely
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Resources and activities are constantly monitored for security issues
- **Automated Response**: Security events automatically trigger appropriate responses
- **Centralized Management**: Security findings from multiple services are aggregated in Security Hub
- **Alerting**: Critical security events generate notifications for security personnel

## Detailed Instructions

### Task 1: Configure AWS CloudTrail

1. **Set Up a Multi-Region Trail**
   - Sign in to AWS Management Console
   - Navigate to CloudTrail Dashboard
   - Click "Create trail"
   - Configure the trail:
     - Name: `SecurityTrail`
     - Storage location: Create a new S3 bucket (CloudTrail will create with proper permissions)
     - Log file SSE-KMS encryption: Enabled (create a new KMS key)
     - Log file validation: Enabled
     - Multi-region trail: Enabled
     - Management events: All Read/Write events
     - Data events: S3 objects (Read/Write)
     - Insights events: Enabled

2. **Configure CloudTrail Log File Integrity Validation**
   - The log file validation option was enabled during creation
   - To verify logs have not been modified:
     - Navigate to the S3 bucket where logs are stored
     - CloudTrail stores digest files alongside log files
     - You can use the AWS CLI to validate log files:
   ```bash
   aws cloudtrail validate-logs --trail-arn <your-trail-arn> --start-time <start-time>
   ```

3. **Configure CloudTrail Insights**
   - CloudTrail Insights help you identify unusual API activity in your account
   - Navigate to your trail settings
   - In the "Insights events" section, ensure it's enabled for:
     - API call rate
     - API error rate
   - Save the changes
   - It may take up to 36 hours for Insights to begin appearing

### Task 2: Set Up AWS Config

   REQUIRED_TAGS = ['Owner', 'Environment', 'Project']
   
   def evaluate_compliance(configuration_item, rule_parameters):
       if configuration_item['resourceType'] not in ['AWS::EC2::Instance', 'AWS::S3::Bucket']:
           return 'NOT_APPLICABLE'
       
       tags = configuration_item['configuration'].get('tags', [])
       tag_keys = [tag['key'] for tag in tags]
       
       for required_tag in REQUIRED_TAGS:
           if required_tag not in tag_keys:
               return 'NON_COMPLIANT'
       
       return 'COMPLIANT'
   
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       invoking_event = json.loads(event['invokingEvent'])
       configuration_item = invoking_event['configurationItem']
       
       compliance_type = evaluate_compliance(configuration_item, event['ruleParameters'])
       
       evaluation = {
           'ComplianceResourceType': configuration_item['resourceType'],
           'ComplianceResourceId': configuration_item['resourceId'],
           'ComplianceType': compliance_type,
           'OrderingTimestamp': configuration_item['configurationItemCaptureTime']
       }
       
       config.put_evaluations(
           Evaluations=[evaluation],

### Terraform Clean-Up (If Applicable)

If you deployed resources using Terraform, clean-up is much simpler:

1. **Navigate to your Terraform project directory**
   ```bash
   cd lab4-terraform
   ```

2. **Destroy all resources**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

3. **Confirm destruction**
   - Type `yes` when prompted
   - Wait for all resources to be destroyed
   - Terraform will output "Destroy complete!" when finished

### Final Check for Hidden Resources

Some resources can be easily missed during clean-up. Check these areas:

1. **CloudWatch Log Groups**
   - Navigate to CloudWatch > Log groups
   - Delete any log groups created during the lab

2. **IAM Roles**
   - Check IAM Dashboard > Roles
   - Delete any created for this lab

3. **KMS Keys**
   - Check KMS Dashboard
   - Disable and schedule deletion of any keys created for this lab

Remember that leaving resources running in AWS will incur charges. Always verify that all resources have been properly deleted after completing labs.
