## Detailed Instructions

### Task 1: AWS Account Creation

1. **Create an AWS Free Tier Account**
   - Navigate to [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
   - Click "Create a Free Account"
   - Enter your email address and choose an AWS account name
   - Follow the prompts to complete account creation:
     - Provide personal information
     - Enter payment information (required, but you won't be charged if you stay within free tier limits)
     - Verify your identity via phone
     - Select a support plan (Free tier is sufficient)
   
   > **Note**: After creating your account, you'll receive a confirmation email. It may take a few minutes for your account to be fully activated.

2. **Sign in to AWS Management Console**
   - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
   - Sign in using your root account credentials (email and password)
   - You should now see the AWS Management Console dashboard

### Task 2: Secure Your Root Account

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Root Account**
   - In the AWS Management Console, click on your account name in the top-right corner
   - Select "Security credentials" from the dropdown menu
   - In the "Multi-factor authentication (MFA)" section, click "Assign MFA device"
   - Choose your preferred MFA device type:
     - **Virtual MFA device**: Use an authenticator app on your smartphone (recommended)
     - **U2F security key**: Use a physical security key
     - **Hardware TOTP token**: Use a hardware token
   - For virtual MFA:
     - Install an authenticator app on your phone (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
     - Scan the QR code displayed on screen
     - Enter two consecutive MFA codes from your authenticator app
     - Click "Assign MFA"
   
   > **Important**: Store your MFA device securely. If you lose access to your MFA device, recovery can be challenging.

2. **Create a Strong Password for Root Account**

## Optional Challenge: Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This section introduces Terraform for deploying AWS resources using code. Terraform allows you to define infrastructure in configuration files that can be versioned, reused, and shared.

### Prerequisites for Terraform Section

- [Terraform installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and configured
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

### Setting Up Terraform for AWS

1. **Configure AWS CLI**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Run `aws configure`
   - Enter your IAM user's access key and secret key
   - Enter your default region (e.g., `us-east-1`)
   - Enter your preferred output format (e.g., `json`)

2. **Create a Terraform Project**
   - Create a new directory for your Terraform project
   - Inside this directory, create a file named `main.tf`
   - Add the following code to `main.tf`:

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-east-1"  # or your preferred region
   }

   # Create an IAM user
   resource "aws_iam_user" "terraform_user" {
     name = "terraform-user"
   }

   # Create an IAM policy for read-only access
   resource "aws_iam_policy" "readonly_policy" {
     name        = "ReadOnlyAccess-Terraform"
     description = "Provides read-only access to AWS services"
     
     policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17"
       Statement = [
         {
           Action   = [
             "ec2:Describe*",
             "s3:Get*",
             "s3:List*"
           ]
           Effect   = "Allow"
           Resource = "*"
         }
       ]
     })
   }

   # Attach the policy to the user
   resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "readonly_attachment" {
     user       = aws_iam_user.terraform_user.name
     policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.readonly_policy.arn
   }

   # Create an S3 bucket with encryption
   resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_bucket" {
     bucket = "secure-terraform-bucket-${random_string.suffix.result}"
   }

   # Generate a random suffix for the bucket name
   resource "random_string" "suffix" {
     length  = 8
     special = false
     upper   = false
   }

   # Enable encryption for the S3 bucket
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "bucket_encryption" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.id
     
     rule {
       apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
         sse_algorithm = "AES256"
       }
     }
   }

   # Block public access to the S3 bucket
   resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "block_public_access" {
     bucket = aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.id
     
     block_public_acls       = true
     block_public_policy     = true
     ignore_public_acls      = true
     restrict_public_buckets = true
   }

   # Output the name of the created bucket
   output "bucket_name" {
     value = aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.bucket
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**
   - In your terminal, navigate to your Terraform project directory
   - Run `terraform init`
   - This will download the necessary providers and initialize your project

4. **Plan Your Infrastructure**
   - Run `terraform plan`
   - Review the planned changes to ensure they match your expectations

5. **Apply Your Infrastructure**
   - Run `terraform apply`
   - Type `yes` when prompted to confirm
   - Wait for Terraform to create the resources
   - Note the outputs, including your S3 bucket name

6. **Verify Resources in AWS Console**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console
   - Navigate to IAM and verify the new user was created
   - Navigate to S3 and verify the new bucket was created with encryption enabled

7. **Clean Up Resources (Important!)**
   - When you're done experimenting, run `terraform destroy`
   - Type `yes` when prompted to confirm
   - This will remove all resources created by Terraform to avoid unexpected charges
