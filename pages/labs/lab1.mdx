# Lab 1: AWS Account Fundamentals

## Overview

This introductory lab will establish your foundation in cloud security by guiding you through the deployment of basic cloud resources with essential security controls. You'll gain hands-on experience implementing security measures across multiple layers of the cloud stack.

## Prerequisites

- AWS free tier account (instructions for setup provided below)
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- Laptop with a modern web browser
- AWS CLI installed (optional but recommended)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to:

- Deploy and configure a secure cloud environment in AWS
- Implement secure network configurations using VPCs and security groups
- Configure proper storage security for S3 buckets
- Set up basic monitoring and logging via CloudTrail
- Conduct a fundamental security assessment of your deployment

## Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Account Setup and Security Hardening

1. Create an AWS free tier account if you don't already have one
2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your root account
3. Create an IAM user with appropriate permissions for this lab
4. Implement password policies according to best practices

### Task 2: Secure Network Configuration

1. Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets
2. Configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to restrict traffic
3. Set up security groups for granular access control
4. Deploy a bastion host for secure administrative access

### Task 3: Secure Storage Implementation

1. Create an S3 bucket with appropriate access controls
2. Enable encryption for data at rest
3. Implement bucket policies to prevent public access
4. Configure access logging for the bucket

### Task 4: Monitoring and Logging

1. Enable AWS CloudTrail across all regions
2. Set up CloudWatch alarms for specific security events
3. Configure log retention policies
4. Create a simple dashboard to visualize security metrics

## Submission Requirements

Submit the following items through the course submission portal:

1. Screenshots documenting the completion of each task
2. A security assessment report (1-2 pages) identifying:
   - Security controls implemented
   - Potential vulnerabilities in your deployment
   - Recommendations for additional security measures
3. Answers to the reflection questions provided at the end of the lab

## Additional Challenges (Optional)

- Implement AWS Config to monitor for compliance violations
- Set up GuardDuty for threat detection
- Create an automated response using Lambda for specific security events
