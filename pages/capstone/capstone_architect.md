## Project Overview

**Role:** As a Cloud Security Architect for MedTech, you will design and implement secure cloud infrastructure to support the organization's AI transformation. Your focus is creating a foundational cloud architecture pattern that balances security controls with the performance requirements of AI workloads while adhering to AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

Key Responsibilities
- Design secure AWS infrastructure components
- Implement defense-in-depth security controls
- Document security architecture decisions
- Ensure HIPAA compliance for healthcare data
- Create reusable infrastructure patterns


**Final Deliverable:** 15-20 minute presentation with slides

## Project Scope

### Choose ONE Infrastructure Pattern (or your own):

#### Option A: Secure Compute Environment
- VPC with public/private subnets
- Bastion host for secure access
- Application servers in private subnet
- S3 bucket for data storage
- Security groups and NACLs

#### Option B: Secure Data Lake
- S3 buckets (raw/processed/archive)
- IAM roles for data access
- Encryption implementation
- VPC endpoints for private access
- CloudTrail logging

#### Option C: Three-Tier Architecture
- Load balancer (public)
- Web servers (private)
- Database (isolated)
- Security groups per tier
- Encryption in transit/at rest

### What You'll Design (Not Build):
- Architecture diagram with security controls
- Security group rules and network flow
- IAM policies for least privilege
- Encryption strategy
- Monitoring and logging approach

## Resources

### Architecture Diagram Tools
- draw.io (free, has AWS icons)
- Lucidchart (free trial)
- AWS Architecture Icons (official)
- PowerPoint with AWS shapes

### AWS Documentation
- [Well-Architected Security Pillar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/)
- [AWS Security Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/security/best-practices/)
- [VPC Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-best-practices.html)

### Example Security Group Rules
```
Bastion Host:
- Inbound: SSH (22) from Company IP only
- Outbound: SSH (22) to Private Subnet

Application Server:
- Inbound: SSH (22) from Bastion only
- Inbound: HTTPS (443) from Load Balancer
- Outbound: HTTPS (443) to Internet
- Outbound: Database port to RDS subnet

Database:
- Inbound: MySQL (3306) from App Subnet only
- No outbound rules needed
```

### Sample IAM Policy Structure
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::medtech-data/*",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "10.0.0.0/16"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Slide Design Tips
1. **One concept per slide** - Don't overcrowd
2. **Use diagrams** - Visual > text
3. **Consistent formatting** - Same fonts, colors
4. **AWS icons** - Use official icons
5. **Speaker notes** - Details go here, not on slide

### Practice Questions to Prepare For
- Why did you choose this architecture pattern?
- How does this meet HIPAA requirements?
- What's your biggest security concern?
- How would you handle a breach?
- What's the approximate monthly cost?
- How does this scale?

## Success Criteria

Your presentation should demonstrate:
1. **Clear understanding** of cloud security principles
2. **Practical application** of AWS security services
3. **Risk awareness** and mitigation strategies
4. **Professional communication** of technical concepts
5. **Thoughtful design** decisions with justification

Remember: You're presenting a security architecture design, not implementing it. Focus on clearly explaining your security decisions and demonstrating your understanding of cloud security principles.
