## Project Overview

**Role:** As a Cloud Security Analyst for MedTech, you will evaluate a pre-built AWS environment against the Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix (CSA CCM) and AWS Well-Architected Framework. Your analysis will identify security gaps, assess risks, and provide actionable recommendations for improving the security posture of MedTech's AI infrastructure.

Key Responsibilities
- Conduct systematic security assessment using CCM framework
- Map findings to AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Identify and prioritize security gaps
- Assess risks with business impact analysis
- Provide actionable, AWS-specific remediation guidance
- Document compliance status for healthcare requirements

**Final Deliverable:** 15-20 minute presentation with slides

## Project Scope

### Assessment Focus Areas (Choose 3):

1. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
   - User permissions and MFA
   - Root account usage
   - IAM policy analysis
   - Role configurations

2. **Data Security & Privacy (DSP)**
   - S3 bucket configurations
   - Encryption status
   - Public access settings
   - Data classification

3. **Infrastructure Security (IVS)**
   - VPC configurations
   - Security group rules
   - Network segmentation
   - Internet exposure

4. **Logging & Monitoring (LOG)**
   - CloudTrail configuration
   - CloudWatch setup
   - Log retention
   - Alert configurations

### Assessment Requirements:
- Review 15 specific controls across your 3 chosen domains
- Identify at least 5 significant findings
- Provide risk ratings and remediation recommendations
- Map findings to AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Resources

### CCM Assessment Approach

### Evidence Collection Commands

```bash
# Quick evidence collection
aws iam get-account-summary
aws iam get-account-password-policy
aws s3api list-buckets
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?IpRanges[?CidrIp==`0.0.0.0/0`]]]'
aws cloudtrail describe-trails
```

### Risk Rating Framework

| Severity | Likelihood | Risk Level | Priority |
|----------|------------|------------|----------|
| Critical | Likely | CRITICAL | Immediate |
| High | Likely | HIGH | 1-2 days |
| High | Possible | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Medium | Likely | MEDIUM | 1 week |
| Medium | Possible | LOW | 1 month |
| Low | Any | LOW | As resources allow |

### Finding Template

```markdown
Finding #1: Public S3 Bucket Exposure
- Domain: DSP (Data Security & Privacy)
- Control: DSP-03
- Risk: CRITICAL
- Evidence: Screenshot showing public access
- Impact: Patient data could be exposed
- Remediation: Enable S3 Block Public Access
- AWS Steps: Console > S3 > Bucket > Permissions > Block Public Access
```

### Slide Design Tips
1. **Visual risk matrix** - Use heat map
2. **Screenshots** - Blur sensitive data
3. **Icons** - Use AWS service icons
4. **Charts** - Show finding distribution
5. **Color coding** - Red/yellow/green for risk

### Practice Questions to Prepare For
- How did you prioritize findings?
- Which finding poses the biggest risk?
- What's the cost of remediation?
- How long to implement all fixes?
- What about compensating controls?
- How does this affect HIPAA compliance?

## Success Criteria

Your presentation should demonstrate:
1. **Systematic assessment** using CCM framework
2. **Clear evidence** supporting findings
3. **Accurate risk** assessment and prioritization
4. **Practical remediation** with AWS-specific steps
5. **Professional delivery** appropriate for management

Remember: Focus on the most impactful findings. Quality over quantity. Make recommendations actionable and specific to AWS.
